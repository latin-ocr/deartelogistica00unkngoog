connected with the doctrine of Logaritth‚ unnecessary to be
considered 11010, showing its natural affinity to the system of the
Arabic 1101811011, which in fact only became 1101100115γ developed
when the Logarithms were invented3 and it is singular that,
among the mathematica] stores of those distant climes from
which was derived the refined and powerful 1101811011 111 question,
and throughout the long ages of its operation in the hands of
genius, not a trace can be discovered of a conception of that
development of the scale which Napier accomplished in the
Logarithms and the arithmetic of Decimal fractionS. The
Chinese are said to have laid claim to the invention3 but the
splendid copy of 1110 Logarithms which issued from the imperial
press of Pekin‚ contains certain 011018 which have been recently
discovered in the European 1811108, previously published.

Napier's mode of demonstratin g the Logarithms‚ by the

motion of points (fluxu puncti) generating two lines—the one

‘⁶ when the point describing the same goeth forward equal .

spaces in equal times 01· 111011101118,” and the other (which,
to facilitate his operationS‚ he took in the decreasing ratic,
having complete command of the arithmetic of negative
quantities‚) ‘⁶ when the point, describing the same in equal
times, cutteth off parts continuauy of the same proportion
