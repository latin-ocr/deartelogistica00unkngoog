the relation of each to the original form, even when the
numerals are withdrawn. By this simple process there is
actually obtained an equivalent for the nine significant digits
of Arithmetic, susceptible of the same combinations, yet per-
fectly distinct in character. Napier’s unit of this system is
-1, and when the root which he wishes to represent is beyond
the original value of the highest of his digit-s, which is Γ,
corresponding to 9, he obtains the tenth value by moving his
unit one step to the left, indicating the move by placing a
circle on the right of the significant digit, thus, ,Ιῆ In like
manner, his unit in· its first place combined with the same
advanced a step, thus 211, indicates the root of the llth
division, or undecupartient root, as he named it. Thus having
invented a new set of digits equivalent to l, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, he submitted them to the same law of progression as in
ordinary arithmetic.

Upon comparing the fragment of Geometrical Logistic
with the first book of his Algebra, which Napier calls the

nominate part of Algeer it will be obvious, that the latter had
