most expeditious of all for multiplication, and which, on that
account, Ι have not inaptly termed the Panum-muns or mem-
rmcxnon, is by means of little plates of metal disposed in a
box. And, lastly, a third method, namely, LocAL Am'rnum’lc
performed upon a chess-boaaed. But, to the publication of this
little work, concerning the mechanism and use of the rodS, I
was specially impelled, not merely by the fact that they are so
approved of as to be already almost in common use, and even
carried to foreign countries3 but because it also reached my
ears that your kindness advised me so to do, lest they should
be published in the name of another, and Ι be compelled to
sing with Virgil,

' ⁸ Hos ego versiculos feci,’ 8112.

This ver)⁷ friendly eounsel from your Lordship ought to have
the greatest weight with me3 and most assuredly, but for that,
this little treatise of the use of the rods (to which the other two
compendious methods are added, by way of appendix), would
never have seen the light. If, therefore, any thanks be due from
the studente of mathematics for these little books, they all belong
to you as your just right, my noble Lord3 to you, indeed,
they must spontaneously fly, not only as patron, but a second
parent: especially since I am assured that you have done these
