sequently become sensible of the defect both of this notation
and nomination. ’The numbers, or rather quantitieS, particu-
larly dependent upon the nomenclature in question, are surdS,
which cannot be expressed in effable numbers, whether in-
tegers or fractionS. Accordingly, in his Arithmetic (p. ll),
after showing, for instance, that the surd quantity, called the
cube root of 9, lurks between the numbers 2 and 3, Napier
adds, ‘⁶ But geometricians, studione of greater accuracy, prefer
the mode of prefixing the sign of the index to the radicate
itself, instead of including the root between two terme. For·
example, they note the tripartient root of 9 thus, 41139, which
they pronounce the cube root of 9. I, however, note it thuS,
1,.9, and call it the tripartient root of 93 of which signs I shall
more fully speak in their proper place. Hence arises geome-
trica] or concrete numbers, commonly called irratione] and
surd.” This was tantamount to naming the cube root of 9 (01·
whatever power be taken) the third root, and noting it by an
equivalent numeral index3 for we shall immediately see that
the symbol Ι- was an invention of Napier’s, to represent the
numeral 3 used for a special purpose.

Along with a nomination expressive of the index, or quality
of the root, it was Napier's object to establish a notation which,
in like manner, would immediately suggest to the eye, not
