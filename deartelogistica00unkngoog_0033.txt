The late Lord Napier, whose untimely death in China, a
few years ago, attracted the mom-nful interest of the public,
intrusted to myself, before his departure on that mission, the
many curious and valuable historical relies of his family, with
full permission to publish whatever might serve to illustrate
the history and letters of Scotland. This task I have now
accomplished, with at least industrious zeal, in the Memoirs
of Merchiston, the History of the Lennox, the Memoirs of
Montrose, and, finally, the editing of this beautiful, though
unfinished treatise, DE Ama Loe1sr10A.

The authenticity of the MS„ as an unpubh‘shed work of the
Inventor of Logaritth, being thus unquestionable, the date
of its composition becomes an interesting enquiry, in reference
to the history of science in Scotland. As Napier died in the
year 1617, no later date can be assigned to these mathematical
studies than the commencement of the seventeenth century——
an epoch when the light of science is only said to have dawned,
in our country, because of the publication of his own invention
of Logarithms. From the interna] evidence, however, there is
every reason to suppose, that, when so much of his Arithmetic
and Algebra was thus ‘⁶ orderlie sett doun ” by Napier, the
system of Logarithms was not only unknown to the world,
but had not as yet been developed in the mind of the inventor
