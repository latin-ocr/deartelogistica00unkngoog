signs himself ⁶ Peer of Merchiston.’ Mr Mark Napier‚ in the
Life of his great ancestor (1834), says, that the true signature
is Fear of Merchiston, and that Fear means that he was invest-
ed with the Fee of his paterna] barony. Peer might have been
a printer's or transcriber’s substitution for Fear‚ or Fear might

have been rejected by Napier for the more common word
Peer.”—(Illust. Henry IV.‚ Act I.)

But there can be no doubt, that, in the instance relied upon‚
Peer was simply a misprint for Feer. That Napier had so
written his signature for the edition of 1645, the only instance
of its occurrence, is put out of the question by the fact, that,
before that date, he had been dead for eight-and-twenty years.
The following is a perfect fac-simile of his signature to a

leuse, dated at his place of Gartnes, 23d April, 1584 :—
