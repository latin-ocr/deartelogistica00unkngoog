adopted by Sir Isaac Newton‚ in similar tel-ms, to illustrate
his own discovery of Fluxions. The accidental circumstance,
or first idea, which may ‚have led any great inventor into
the path of his distinction, can rarely be discovered. I have

endeavoured to illustrate Napier's progress to the Lo ga- ¹

rithms through his mathematica] studies now published.
Newton himself, in his treatise of the Quadratum of Cui-ves,
announces the method that led him to his great discovery of
FluxionS. ‘⁶ I consider‚” he sayS‚ ‘⁶ mathematica] quantities
in this place not as consisting of very small parts, but as
described by a continued motion. Lines are described, and
therefore, generated‚ not by the opposition of parts, but by the
continued motion of points ; superficies by the motion of lines ;
solids by the motion of superficies ; angles by the rotation of
the sides; portions of time by a continual flux3 and so in
other quantities. These geneses really take place in the nature
of things, and are daily seen in the motion of bodies. And
aster this manner the ancients‚ by drawing moveable right
lines along immoveable right lineS‚ taught the genesis of rect-
angleS. Therefore‚ considering that quantities which increase
in equa] times, and by increasing are generated‚ become greater'
or less according to the greater or less velocity with which they
increase and are generated‚ I sought a method of determining

quantities from the velocities of the motion or increments
