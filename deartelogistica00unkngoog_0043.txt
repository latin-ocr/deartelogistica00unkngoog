metic. It must be observed‚ however, that the expressions
quoted are written on the margin of Robert Napier’s manu-
script, and there is a mark in the text where the note should
be inserted‚—a direction complied with in printing the present
volume (p. 42). Probably this note was an addition of the
transcriber’s ; or perhaps Napier himself had subsequently
added it to his MS„ after the invention of the calculating rods
had occurred. If the note be contemporary with the composi-
tion of the treatise‚ then undoubtedly the latter is of a sub-
sequent date to his R-habdologia. But there is another circum-
stance which seems to render this supposition totally out of the
question. In Napier's Arithmetic occurs a genesis of decimal
fractions‚ and perhaps the earliest on record But the peculiar
notation of decimals‚—from which the system derives all its
power as a reciprocation of the Arabic scale, and which Napier
could not have failed to use and comment upon in any notice
of a decimal fraction., when once aware of the expedient,—
is not hinted at in the treatise on Arithmetic. Now, in the
Rhabdologia„ there is a section (of the fourth chapter) entitled
‘⁶ Admonitio pro Decimali Arithmetica‚'’-being his exposition
'of that very notation of decimals which is in use at the present
day. Napier had hit upon this admirable expedient when
constructing his Canon of the Logaritth‚--the first mathe-.
matical work in which the arithmetic of decimal fractions was.
