been framed before the conception of the former. Having
composed two books of Algebra, he had extended his plan so
as to embrace the whole art of Logistic; and the nominate
part of his Algebra would probably have merged in his third
book called Geometrical Logistic, while the second book of
Algebra, which he called the positive or cossic part, in which
unknown quantities are treated of under fictitious representa-
tione, would have formed the fourth and last book of his great
digest of Numbers. It is quite consistent with the nature of
the subject to suppose, that the reason why Napier's book of
the Logistic of concrete quantities by concrete numbers termi-
nates abruptly, and why no other fragment of it could be
found, was, that at this stage of his speculatione, he had set
himself to the invention of Logarithms, which may indeed be
considered as the grand result of the Logistic of concrete

quantities by concrete numberS. These, in all probability,
were the very speculatione which led him to that achievement,

of which Playfair has said, that, ‘⁶ at a period when the nature
of series, and when every other resource of which 116 could

avail himself, were so little known, his success argues a depth
and originality of thought, which, I 3111 persuaded, have rarely

been surpassed.”

Napier’s device for the notation of surds is of itself suffi-
