steps being deduced from this 0116, the trifling error in question
is thus carried on through the calculations. Ι corrected his
error, and then, adopting his own method‚ but abridging the
operations by our more rapid processes of developement, Ι
calculated the logarithm of 5000000, which is the last in
Napier's table, and consequently that upon which all the errors
accumulate. Ι found for its value 6931471 .808942 3 whereas,
by the modern serieS‚ it ought to be 6931471805599. Thus
the difference commences at the tenth figure. Ι calculated,
in like manner, the hyperbolic logarithm‚ with Napier’s
numbers corrected, and found for its value 23025850940346,
while, by our present tables‚ it 'is 230258509299403 so
the real difference only falls 011 the ninth decimal. But
this is beyond the range of the tables of Callet, which are in
daily use. If Napier had even commanded the services of
a village schoolmaster‚ to calculate‚ by the inventor’s own
method of subu-actions, a geometrical progression still slower
than what he used, a desideratum to' which he himself calls
attention, the tables of Bri ggS‚ calculated to fourteen deci-
· 111616, would have possessed no superiority over those of
Napier. His minor inventions are scarcely worth mention-

ing after this immense invention of Logaritth. That was

sufficient for the lifetime, as it is for the 161116, of 6. single
individual.”
