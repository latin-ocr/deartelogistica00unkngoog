1NTRoDUc‘r10N. xix

concluding sentences of his Canon afford so interesting a
view of the last labours of Napier’s life, that Ι may here
quote them from the English translation of 1616, which he
revised himself 2—-

“ Now, therefore, it hath been sufficiently showed that there
are Logaritth, what they are, and of what use they are 3 for
with help of them, we have both demonstratively showed, and
taught by examples of both kinds of trigonometry, that the
arithmetical solution of anyr geometrica] question may most
’ readily be performed without trouble of multiplication, division,
or extraction of roots. You have, therefore, the admirable
table of Logarithms that was promised, together with the most
plentiful use thereof, which, if (to you of the learned sort) Ι by
your letters understh to be acceptable to you, Ι shall be
encouraged to set forth also the way to make the table. In
the mean time, make use of this short treatise, and give all
praise and glory to God, the high Inventor and Guider of all
good works.”

Then follows an isolated sentence which he terms ‘⁶ Admo-
nitio ;” and, probably, he refers to his theologica] labours when,
in that sentence, he speaks of ‘⁶ rerum graviorum cura'’ having

interfered with the perfecting of his mathematica-l work 2-
