operose calculations were entirely performed by himself. M.
Biot, in his review and ‘⁶ extruit ’³ of the· Memoirs of Napier,
published in the Journal des Savans for the year 1835, after
passing the highest encomiums upon the genius of Napier's

works, thus speaks of the mechanical labour of the calcula-

“ Besides the merit of the invention, Napier’s tables are a
prodigy of laborious patience. As we reflect upon the time

and toil it must have cost him to calculate all those numbers,
we shudder at the chauces there were of his being cut off ere

he had realized his idea, and of its having died with him. It '
