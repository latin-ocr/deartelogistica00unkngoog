of the same digit in space—a new set of digits of his own
invention, intended for the Arithmetic of SurdS, is well worthy

of attention.

Napier commences what he terms Geometrical Logistic
with an important principle,--his profound cousideration and
command of which most probably paved the way to his great ·
invention. He views quantity and number under two different
aspects or conditions; namely, either as separated into distinct
partS, capable of being exactly expressed by absolute numberS,
or fractions of numbers, which he terms discrete quantity and
number3 or, as consisting of an infinite continuity of partS,
not to be so expressed by numbers ; and this he terms concrete
quantity or numbers. ‘⁶ 113⁹> says he, ‘⁶ 3 a” (by which he means

3 of any given quantity) ‘⁶ refer to three digital lines, thus,

 

 

 

, it is a discrete number3 but if it refer
to a concrete and continuous tri-digital line, in this form,

· , it is called a concrete number3 though
not a proper concrete number, but only in relation to the
quantity to which it refers. A proper concrete number,”
Napier adds, ‘⁶ is the root of a number whose root cannot
be measured3 that is, exactly and finitely expressed by any
number, integral or f1·actional.’9 He had already explained

that the numerical quantity, generally termed the Power of a
