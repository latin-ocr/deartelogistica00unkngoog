that invention, that, having achieved the Logaritth, he could
not fail immediately to pereeive the application of fractional
indices for the expression of rootS,—and, consequently, that his
proposed notation of surdS, in his Geometrical Logistic, was
comparatively crude and useless· This fact, which it would
occupy too much space fully to illustrate here, may be offered
as interna] evidence, afforded by the manuscripts now printed,
that they are studies which must have preceded the conception

of his great invention.

That which may truly be said to have led Napier to the
invention of Logarithms, is the profound view he took of
the Logistic of concrete quantity, after having thoroughly mas-
tered that of discrete quantity. The properties of what we
may now term the Logarithms of discrete ratioS, namely,
the series of natural numbers taken to enumerate the steps or
terms of any geometrica] progression represented by integerS,
had been known since the days of Archimedes, But the
desideratum waS, to prove that the infinite series of natural
numbers, l, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &c., might be viewed as in a geome-
trical progression, and then to discover the indices of all these
numberS, considered as powers of some given number,—which
would disclose the corresponding arithmetica] series», and the

Logarithms par excellence. Less profoundly considered, the
