trectise of Arithmetic3 but neither is it to be supposed that
he would have written, for instance, the fifth chapter of his
second book of Arithmetic, ‘⁶ De Multiplicationis et Parti-
tionis Compendiis MiscellaneiS,” after having published the
Logarithms, without the slightest allusion to that means of
substituting, for the real numbers, a set of artificial numbers
rendering the whole art of calculation compendious beyond the
most sanguine hopes of emancipated Astronomy.

It is even more improbable that the treatises in question
were composed, or so far reduced to order, at some period in
the long interval which must have elapsed between the author's
conception of the Logarithms, and the construction of those
elaborate works by which the glory of the ⁸invention was
secured. to himself, and the benefit bestowed upon mankind.
In his book of Geometrical Logistic, Napier seems to allude
to the Arithmetic of Surds as a discovery of his own, the full
velue of which he promises asterwards to disclose. Had he
been conscious at this time of the far more important secret of
the Logarithms,—which, aster his first conception of the idea,
was his daily labour to the end of his days,-there would, in
all probability, have been some allusion to it. ⁴Indeed, his
great invention must have formed a most interesting chapter

of his work DE Am Loo1s'r10A, had he lived to complete it.
