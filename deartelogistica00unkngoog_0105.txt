is to be found. Yet the great lever with which Newton worked
was the Logarithms ; and the Binomial Theorem, says Baron

MasereS, “ is so very closely connected with the subject of
Logaritth, as to be the foundation of the best methods of

computing them.”

In Napier’s Arithmetic, (p. 50‚) which Newton certainly
never saw, there is a figurate diagram, worthy of especial
notice, as being an unknown anticipation of the Arithmetical
Triangle of the celebrated Blaise Pascal 3 presented, however,
in a far more beautiful form than that of the French mathe-
matician. The properties of this triangle are so intimately
connected with the Binomial Theorem, that Bernoulli, on that
account, somewhat rashly claims for Pascal the merit of the.
invention. ‘⁶ Nous avons trouv6,” he sayS, ‘⁶ ce merveilleux
theoreme aussi bien que M. Newton, d’une maniere plus simple
que la sienne. Feu M. Pascal a ete le premier qui l’a
inventee.” MasereS, who republished Pascal’s mathematica]
workS, says of them,—-“ These works are so full of genius and
invention, that I thought I should do a service to the mathe-
maticians of Great Britain by republishing them in this collec-
tion. Some of them, and more especially his Arithmetical
Triangle, have a considerable connexion with Logaritth,
by affording a good demonstration of Sir Isaac Newton’s
