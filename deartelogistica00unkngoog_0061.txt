Which 111111 Neper taking, he desii-ed him at his return to call
upon him again. Craig, after some weeks had passed, did 8ο,
and Neper then shewed him a rude draught of what he called
Canon Mirabilis Logarithmorum. Which draught‚ with some

hands of our author Briggs‚ and into those of Will. Oughtred‚

Any one at all conversam with the history of 86161166, and
the nature of the invention of Logarithms‚ will at once per-
eeive‚ that, whatever foundation in fact this anecdote may
have, it is here inaccurately and ignorantly told. Longomon-
tanus was the pupil and assistant of Tyeho at Uraniburg‚ and
a most distinguished mathematician. He, in common with
many others, was well acquainted with a principle of numerical
progression‚ the extraordinary generalization of which by
Napier is that which constitutes the invention of Logarithms.
Archimedes had first observed and speculated upon such pro·
gressions‚ but without discovering the Logarithms. It could not
possibly be, that a 111111 from Longomontanus had suggested
to Napier his great invention3 for if a 111111 of the kind could
have urged any human 1111611661 111118 rapidly upon the concep-
tion of the Logarithms themselves, that hint had arisen in the
