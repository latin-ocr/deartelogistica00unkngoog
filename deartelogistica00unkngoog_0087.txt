ciple of its operation, and had also turned his mind to new

inventions in notation‚ may be gathered from these manu-
scripts, In the first chapter of the second book of his Arith-

metic‚ in which he discusses the nomination and notation of
numerical quantities‚ he says that “ every idiom supplies its own
vocal nomination 3 but that the written names of integers are .
the nine significant figures,—l‚ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; and
that these signify various numerical valueS., according to their

change of place. This progreSS‚” he adds), “ is from right to
left3 and the circle Ο, which has no signification wherever it be

“ placed, is merely used to indicate the progress of the significant

figure, by representing the vacancy which that has occasioned
in its progress, When the significant figure is occupying its
first place, it is named,'’ says Napier‚ “ according to its own
individua] value3 when it has progressed to the second place, it
is named by its tenfold value 3 in the third place, a hundredfold 3
and so on by an infinite progres8‚ each step attaching to the
figure a value equal to the multiplication of the last step by ten.''
Such is Napier’s explanation of that all-powerfiil though simple
expedient3 and none more accurate and lucid has been afforded
during the two centuries and a half which have elapsed since
he composed his digest of Numbers. The extreme ingenuity
