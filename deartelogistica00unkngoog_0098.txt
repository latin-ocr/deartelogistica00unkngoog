eient to prove that his invention of the Logarithms was sub-
sequent to sueh speculations 3 for the mind which accomplished
the Logarithms‚ and eompounded that name for them, could
scarcely fail very soon to pereeive that the radica] sigm, expres-
sive of a surd root, were to be entirely superseded ΒΥ fractional
exponents. Dr Hutton committed a strange anachronism‚ and
one which does injustiee to the genius of Napier, in the follow-
ing passage :—“ The notation of powers and roots, ΒΥ the pre-
sent mode of exponents‚ has introduced a new and general
arithmetie of exponents or powers3 for henee powers are
multiplied ΒΥ only adding their exponents‚ divided ΒΥ subtract-
ing the exponentS‚ raised to other powerS‚ or roots of them
extraeted‚ ΒΥ multiplying or dividing the exponent ΒΥ the
index of the power or root. So a²><a5=a⁵‚ and abxoeffza} ;
a⁵÷a³=a2‚ and αξ-Ηιὲεωὲς the second power of aa is αθ, and
the third root of αθ is αθ. This algorithm of powers led
the way to the invention of Logarithms‚ whieh are only the
indices or exponents of powers 3 and hence the addition and
subtraction of Logarithms answer to the multiplication and
division of numbers, while the raising of powers and the ex-
tracting of roots is effeeted ΒΥ multiplyin g the logarithm ΒΥ the
index of the power, or dividing the logarithm ΒΥ the index of
the root.'’—Math. Diet. If the algorithm of which Dr Hutton
here speaks had belonged to seienee before Napier invented
