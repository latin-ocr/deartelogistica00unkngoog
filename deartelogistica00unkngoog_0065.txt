And now let us grapple with your Tables.'’

This interesting letter, written after he to whom it was

Kepler, whose own immortal discoveries in Astronomy obtained
for him the daring title of Legislator of the HeavenS, bowed
at the shrine of the Logarithms, and at once, and without
reserve, acknowledged Napier as his master in Logistic. A
