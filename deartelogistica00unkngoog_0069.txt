interesting not merely as the works of the Inventor of
Logaritth, but as being the very first of the kind in Scot-
land, and among the first systematic works on Numbers
after the revival of letters in Europe. The sixteenth cen-
tury was the rudent period of algebraic science in Europe.
Leonardo of Pisa, indeed, composed his work before the inven-
tion of printing, and early in the thirteenth century 3 but this
had been lost sight of, and was not known for more than a ’
century after Napier’s death, when the manuscript was disco-
vered at Florence. The first printed work on the subject was
that of Lucas de Burg0, from whom is generally dated the
decided dawn of Algebra in Europe. De Burgo’s principal
work was printed about the year 1494. The second printed
work upon Arithmetic and Algebra appeared in 1539. This
was a work of the great but eccentric Cardan, of whom it is
affirmed by Scaliger that he was so devoted to astrology as
actually to starve himself to death, that his own astrologica]
prediction might be fulfilled,—a very equivocal illustration of
his favourite science. Cardan died in the year 1575. Germany
produced one or· two mathematicians, who, at the same time
that Cardan wrote, gave a more decided impulse to Numbers.
Hitherto nothing had been added to that recondite science,
since the introduction of the Arabic numerals, and the rude
and imperfect symbols of Burgo’s Algebra, except in the
