1 INTRODUCTION.

Napier, in the first chapter of his Aritbmetic, refers to
what he terms Geometrical Logistic, as forming the subject
of his third book, and to Algebra, as being the subject of a
fourth book. It would appear, however, that 1118 Algebra,
so far as ‘⁶ orderlie sett doun,” is an earlier production than
either his Arithmetic or the fragment of Geometrical Logistic,
This is manifest from several circumstances z—l. It is entitled
‘⁶ The Algebra of John Naper, Baron of Merchistoun 3⁹³ but
not Liber Quartus, in correspondence with the other books.
2. Arithmetic is referred to in it; but there is no reference to
his own book of Arithmetic, as there would have been, accord-
ing to his practice throughout the rest of the manuscript, had
that been previously composed. 3.· The treatise of Algebra is
itself divided into two books 3 and, while there is a systematic
reference to its component partS, there is no reference to any
previous books. 4. Napier adopts in his Algebra the nomina-
tion and notation which had been introduced before his time3
whereas, in 1118 Arithmetic and Geometrical Logistic, he
adopts and expounds a peculiar nomination and notation of
his own, applicable to the arithmetic of Surds, and whereby
he proposes to supersede that with which he operates in his
treatise of Algebra. There can be little doubt, therefore, that
his Algebra is a work of still earlier date than the other books 3
and these, as has been seen, were prior in date to his conception
