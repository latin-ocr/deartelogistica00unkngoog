idea. that the arithmetical series, or progression by equi-
difference of the natural numbers, could be viewed as a
geometrical series, or progression by multiplication, seemed
a contradiction in terms. Napier commences by demon-
strating that the progressive increase, or decrease, of a con-
crete or continuous quantity may be conceived to be gener-
ated by a motion in space, so regulated, in respect of the
velocity, as to generate a continuous geometrica] progres-
sion, of infinitely small ratios of magnitude, various terms of
which might be represented, or infinitely nearly so, by the
series of natural numberS, which thus au become terms of
a geometrical progression. In like mannerâ€ž he demonstrated
. the genesis of a correspondin g arithmetical progression by a
simultaneous motion, the velocity of which, being equal through-
out and not increasing or decreasing, generated magnitudes
in an arithmetica] progression, which, at an)r given point of the
progresS, might be represented by a numerica] expression that
would serve for the index, or number of the ratios (logarithm),
of the corresponding point in the simultaneous geometrica]
motion. His idea of motion, thus taken to generate propor-
tional magnitudes, was analogous to the law of the Arabic
notation in discrete numbers, where the significant digit may
be conceived to generate a decuple progression, by travefling

in a line from right to left. There are various circumstances
