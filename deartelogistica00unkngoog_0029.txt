INTRODUCTION.

IN the Memoirs of NAPmn of MnncmsToN, published in 1834„
some account was given of two manuscript treatises—-one of
Arithmetic‚ and the other of Algebra-—composed in Latin by
that celebrated mathematiciam and which had remained in-
edited in the chaster-chest of his family, and indeed unknown
to the world, until the Memoirs were published. Upon that
occasion, little more could be afforded than a very imperfect
review of their contents. The idea subsequently occurred,
that it might gratify the lovers of science if these mathematical
studies of (to adopt the expressions of the historian Hume)
‘⁶ The celebrated Inventor of Logarithms‚ the person to whom
the title of GREAT MAN is more justly due than to any other

whom his country ever produced‚'’—-were added as an appendix
