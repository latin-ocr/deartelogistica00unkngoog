that these means produce nothing which cannot be very easily
attained by his own method3 and if, as it is natural to sup-
pose, this assertion may seem to our analysts something more
than rash, I hope presently to afford unanswerable proofs of
its accuracy. But to form this just idea of Napier’s operations,
it is necessary to study his own works, especially his second
work, in which he unfolds his method,—and not to rely upon
extracts.'’ In reference to the above, M. Biot prefixes to his
review an investigation which he entitles, ‘⁶ Analyse et re-
stitution de l’ouvrage original de Napier, intitule, Mirifici
Logarithmorum Canonis Constructio.”

In the title-page of the constructio, of which Briggs him-
self was one of the editors, will be found an allusion to Napier's
improvement of his own system3 and in the preface, the im-
provement is declar-ed to have originated with Napier himself,
