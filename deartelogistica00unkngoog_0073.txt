In Plance, the celebrated Ramus wrote an elementary
treatise on Arithmfflic and Algebra‚ about the year 15603
but he left the science as 116 found it. Baphael Bombelli,
whose Algebra was published at Bologna in the year 1572, in

Δ Italian, wrote more elaborately and profoundly‚ but did not

add any thing of consequence to the labours of his predecessore.
The first that can be said to have done so, between the time
of Stifellius and of Napier, was Simon Stevinus of BrugeS‚
who published La Praetique d’Arithmetique about the year
1582. Η6 afterwards put forth other works upon Arithmetic
and Algebra‚ along with a translation of some books of Dio-
