which, being multiplied by itself, produces 10 Ρ Not 3 times 3,
that being only 9, nor yet the next number, 4, which gives too
much, namely 16. The doctrine of fractions, indeed, enables
us to express exactly numerica] quantities between 3 and 4,
nearer to each other than the relative ‘quantities indicated by
3 and 4, and consequently a nearer approximation to the
quantity sought. This approximation, however, will still be
found to consist of termS, the one too much, and the other too
little, exactly to express what is required3 and a curious pro-
perty it has, that these fractional terms may be brought closer
and closer together, by an endless approximation, and still no
number obtained which, by being multiplied into itself, wil]
produce the precise number. Hence, numerioally speaking,
the number 10 (being a simple example of an infinity of
numbers in the same predicament) has no root3 that is, no
root capable of finite expression in discrete or absolute num-
ber. “ Now,” says Napier, ‘⁶ a concrete number proper is the
root of such irreduceable number, and these roots are com-

monly called surd and irrational.”

Napier had too strong a hold of his subject to reject these
latent and ineffable roots as no quantity at all, or as incapable
of submission to the rules of Arithmetic, and the purposes of
computation. He views them in their proper concrete charac-
