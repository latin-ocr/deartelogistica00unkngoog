trica, 'which I shall here translate. ⁶⁶ Seeing, therefore, that a

surd uninome may be the root either of an abounding or of a
defective number, and that its index may be either even or odd,
from this fourfold cause it follows, that some surds are abound-
ing, some defective, some both abounding and defective, which I.
term ⁶ gemina 3’ some neither abounding nor defective, which I
call ⁶ nugacia.’ The foundation of this great Algebraic secret
I have already laid in the sixth chapter of the first book ; and,
though hitherto unrevealed by any one else, so far as I know,
the value of it to this art, and to Mathematics in general, shall

presently appear.'’

There can be no doubt that by ⁶⁶ nugacia” Napier means
the impossible quantity, and that he was the very first to con-
ceive the idea, and to propose its use, in the arithmetic of

surds and the theory of equationS. · He explains precisely its

⁵ nature, and gives rules for its notation, and applies to it the

starth'ng designations of ⁶⁶ a quantity absurd and impossible,
nonsensical and signifying nothing.” He shows that all rootS,
whether* abounding or defective, (or, as he also terms it,
greater or less than nothing,) when multiplied to an even index
produce an abounding radicate. Thus, take for the root
÷2, and let it be multiplied to the index 4, (in other πνοι-(13,
raised to the fourth power,) and the radicato will be ÷16 3 in
