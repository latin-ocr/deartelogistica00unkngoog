INTRODUCTION. 111ss

merely that a surd root was taken, but what number of root it
was3 and this by symbols entirely new and unappropriated.
Since his day, when roots were to be expressed by radica] signs,
instead of by the number itself evolved‚ the expedient devised
was to retain the contracted R, as the initia] of the word root,
and to place within it a small numeral, as the index of the

quality of the root. Thus ξ] 10 expresses the cube root, or, as
Napier would have called it, the tripartient or third root, of the

number ten considered as a radicatum or power. This notak
tion‚—which, it will be observed‚ gets rid of the unwieldy
expedient of repeating the initials Q, ⁶8, and st, for square,
eabe, and supersolid‚ and presents to the eye the number of
evolutions requisite to obtain the particular root‚—-was not
invented until many years after Napier's death. Now, the
notation to which he refers, in the sentence quoted above, was
so devised as at once to express that a root, of that number to
which it was attached, was the quantity taken, the partiemur
number or index of that root, and the fact that the root was a
surd root, or concrete quantity. He took this simple combina-

tion of equal lines ss': intersecting each other at equal

intervals. In the nine compartments, which this figure
presents, he inserted the nine numerals‚--for the sake, he
says, of assisting the memory. From the natural arrange-
