theory of equationS, which had received a great extension
from Tartalea and Cardan. The defect which materially
impeded the system was in notation, the mainspring of numer-
ical science. In the year 1544, Michael Stifellius, a Lutheran
clergyman, published at Nuremberg his Arithmetica Integra,
a very original Latin treatise on Arithmetie and Algebra,
wherein he viewed numerical quantitieS, and their combina-
tionS, closely and ingeniously, and gave an impulse to Algebra
by improving its notation. He was the first to introduce the
signs 4- and — for plus and minue, and also the character ss
(derived from the letter R), to denote the radix or root.
Moreover, he entered systematically into the consideration of
arithmetical and geometrical progressions, pointing out what
may now be termed the logarithmic properties of a correspond-

ing series of the powers of a given number, and the exponents

of those powers, which latter term he uses· But in this spe-
culation he had formed no conception of the possibility of
chan gin g the infinite series of natural numbers from an arith-
metical to a geometrical progression, and then of generating a
corresponding arithmetical progression.

In the year 1552 appeared the first treatise upon Arith-
metic and Algebra in the English language. 'Its author was
the unfortunate Robert Recorde, a mathematician of un-
