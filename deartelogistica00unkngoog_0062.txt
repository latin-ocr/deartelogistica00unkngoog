school of Alexandria, was submerged in the middle ageS, and
rose again with the letters of Greece,—a hint which Tycho
had, which Stifellius, Byrgius, Longomontanus, and Kepler
himself had3 yet no more was made of it after the revival of
letters, than had been by Archimedes before their fall. Kepler
too, informs uS, that in the year 1594, something regarding
the generalization of this numerical principle had actually been
reported in a letter to Tych03 yet the secret was still undis-
covered until Napier published his Canon in 1614. In a
letter, dated 11th March, 1618, to his friend Schikhart,
Kepler, after descanting upon the various difficulties and
resources of trigonometry, exclaims,—“ A Scotish Baron has
started up, his name I cannot remember, but he has put forth
some wonderful mode by which all necessity of multiplications
and divisions is commuted to mere additions and subtractionS,
nor does he make any use of a table of sines 3 still, however,
he requires a canon of tangents, and the variety, frequency, and
difficulty of additions and subtractions, in some cases exceed the
labour of multiplication and division.” This was the first crude
and inaccurate idea formed by Kepler of the work which he had
not yet studied3 and already the Scotish Baron whose name
he could not remember was in his grave! But of this fact
Kepler was not aware even on the 28th J uly, 1619, when hc
thus addressed Napier himself :—
