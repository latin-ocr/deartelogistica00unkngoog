Renfiewshire. During the owner’s absence the house was
burned to, the ground, and the precious relies perished.

As these manuscripts had not been arranged, nor properly
examined, the extent of the loss is unknown 3 but it is more
than probable that among them were the originals from which
N apier's son Robert made the transcripts accidentally pre-
served, and now given to the public. The manner in which
these transcripts had escaped the fate of the Culcreuch papers
appears from the following note, written in the MS. volume
itself‚ by Francis seventh Lord Napier, grandfather of the

present Peer to whom it now belongs 2-

“ John Napier of Merchiston‚ inventor of the Logaritth‚
left his manuscripts to his son Robert‚ who appears to have
caused the following pages to have been written out fair from
his father's notes, for Mr Briggs‚ Professor of Geometry at
Oxford. They were given to Francis, the fifth Lord Napier,
by William Napier of Gula-euch, Esq.‚ heir-male of the above-
named Robert. Finding them, in a neglected state, amongst
my family papers‚ Ι have bound them together, in order to

preserve them entire.

‘⁶ NAPIER.”
