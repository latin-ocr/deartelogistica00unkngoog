the Logarithms, Playfair’s eulogy of him, quoted above, would
not have been merited3 for the arithmetic of powers and
exponente might have disclosed the Logarithms even to an
ordinary mathematician. The more accurate statement is,
that the invention of Logarithms led the way to the algorithm
of powers. Napier,—-writing, be it remembered, some time in
the sixteenth century, before Victa, ⁴Harriot, Girard, and
Oughtred, and when Algebra was not cultivated at all in this
country,—had no assistance from the algebraic refinement of
working known quantities by means of other symbols than the
significant digits, or of expressing powers by means of small
letters instead of numeralS. He did not, for instance, consider
aaaa as the quadruplicatum (to use his own term) of any
number a; still less did he consider the same quantity in this
form, a⁴3 he had neither the litera] notation of powers, nor the
numeral notation of indices 3 for although, in explaining their
genesiS, he named the indices, one, tw0, three, δια, and also
noted and arranged them above the powers by the numerals l,
2, 3, δια, yet he did not systematically attach them to the root
for the expression of the power. To have done so would have
been to anticipate the notation of Descartes, whose epoch is
1637, twenty years after Napier's death. But, while he had
not these advantages to lead him to the Logarithms, the

arithmetic of exponents was so obviously to be deduced from
