x INTRODUCTION.

Not only is there no mention of his Canon of the Loga-
rithms in these treatises, but when, to illustrate the relation

between the powers of numbers and their indices, there is
exhibited the following table,—

Ι. ΙΙ. ΙΙΙ. IIII. V. VI. VII.
1. 2. 4. 8. 16. 82. 64. 128,-

no allusion occurs to the fact, that this table also affords an
illustration of the logarithmic principle. The upper series
are not only indices to the lower series, considered as powers,
but they are Logarithms to those numbers, being an arith-.
metical adapted to a geometrica] progression. The word
Logarithms was compounded by Napier before he published
his discovery, and this term itself embodies the principle
illustrated (though on a very limited scale) by the above
arrangement of figureS. Αςιθμοι signifies numbers3 λογωςιθμοι,
the ratios of numbers, 'or rather the number of ratiOS, λογων
menapos. Now, although Napier expounded his system of
Logarithms through his geometrical idea of fluxions (a de-
monstration and a term afterwards adopted by Newton), and
not through the doctrine of powers and exponente, yet he
could not have composed the term Logarithms without a
perfect knowledge of the connexion οξ his system with the-

arithmetic of proportionS.
