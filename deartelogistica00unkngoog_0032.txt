The transcripts are entirely in the handwriting of Robert
N apier himself, as is ascertainedbeyond doubt by a comparison
with some of his letters in Lord Napier’s charter-chest3 and
this title, written on the first leaf, is also in his handwriting 2——
“ The Baron of Merchiston his booke of Arithmeticke
and Algebra. For Mr Henrie Briggs‚ Professor of Geometrie

at Oxforde.”

That they were taken directly from the author’s own
paperS‚ is proved by the note which the transcriber adds at the
conclusion of the fragment on Geometrical Logistic :—

⁶⁶ Ι could find no more of this Geometricall pairt amongst

all his fragments?

And also by another note which immediately follows the

abrupt termination of the Algebra 2-—
“ There is no more of his Algebra orderlie sett doun.”

These notes, of which fac-similes will be found in their
respective places in this volume, seem to have been addressed
to Henry Briggs3 and they not only prove that the transcripte ’
were made from Napier’s private manuscripts, but that Napier
himself had so far written out the treatises in the form now

published‚ and that more remained to be digested and arranged.
