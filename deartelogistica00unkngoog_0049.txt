Logaritth,—most copiously unfolded, and theii- nature, acci·
dences, and various adaptations to their natural numbers, per·
spicuously demonstrated. I have also thought good to subj oin
to the Construction itself a certain appendix, concerning the
method of forming another and more excellent species of
Logarithms, to which the inventor himself alludes in his epistle
prefixed to the Rhabdologia, and in which the Logarithm of
unity is 0. The treatise which comes last is that which, tend-
ing to the utmost perfection of his Logarithmic trigonometry,
was the fruit of his latest toil,-—na.mely, certain very remarkable
propositions for resolving spherica] triangles, without the neces-
sity of dividing them into quadrantal or rectangular triangleS,
and which are absolutely general. These, indeed, he intended
to have reduced to order, and to have successively demon-
strated, had not death snatched him from us too soon. I have
added some lucubratione upon these propositione, and also upon
the new species of Logarithms, calculated by that most excel-
lent mathematician, Henry Briggs, public professor in London,
who undertook most willingly the very severe labour of this
Canon, in consequence of the singular affection that existed
between him and my father of illustrious memory,——the method
of construction and explanation of its use being left to the
inventor himself. But now, since he has been called· from this

life, the whole burden of the business rests upon the learned
