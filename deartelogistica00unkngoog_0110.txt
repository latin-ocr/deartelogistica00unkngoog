But it appears, that, when Napier had broken ground
upon the great field of equationS, and with a vigour and com-

mand os the subject which obviously was about to anticipato

’ the conquests of many of his illustrious successore, he was

arrested in that progress by another idea. The stars were
becoming too many for Tycho and Kepler3 so he promised
them the Logarithms. His mind had already penetrated the
Arabic system in every direction. He had already orderly set
down how the various operations of number and quantity gra-
dually unfold,—how the vast fabric produces itself, growth after
growth, every rule the parent of another, and the whole inti-
mately related, in all its partS, in endless generations of Num-
bers. Having traced the genealogy of Numbers upwards from
nothing, he had taken zero as the pivot for a reciproca] scale,
and unfolded the logistic of ‘⁶ quantitates minores nihil0,” and
‘⁶ quantitates impossibiles et nihil significantes? Then he had

⁸ viewed unit as broken into another infinite scale, and had

reduced to order all the operations of Arithmetic upon its
fractione. It remained to condense the vast system into greater
simplicity and power, and also to display unit as the pivot for a
reciproca] play of the Arabic scale, as he had done by zero. This
he accomplished by his invention and calculation of Logarithms.
Moreover, in his brilliant performance of that promise to
Tycho, he first applied—before either Newton or Leibnitz—
