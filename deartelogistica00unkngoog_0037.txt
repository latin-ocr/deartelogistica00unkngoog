INTRODUCTION. xi

It can scarcely be doubted, then, that the composition of
Napier's treatise of Numbers is prior in date even to his
conception of the Logarithms3 a conclusion that will seem very
natural to any one who has examined his works on the subject,
and who is at all capable of appreciating the command of the
science of Numbers which those works evince. Undoubtedly,
his great invention was not (as is alleged of the theory of
gravitation) the result of a sudden thought or suggestion, in
some ,happy moment of genius. It was laboriously elicited
from the arcana of NumberS,—-deliberately extracted, by a
sort of Caesarean operation, from the unripe womb of analytical
science. Napier himself alludes to this predetermination of
his genius, in a most interesting letter, the last he ever wrote.
It is prefixed as a dedication, to the Chaucellor of Scotland,
of his RnAnnonomA, or the art of computing by means of
figured rodS, better known by the name of ‘⁶ Neper’s bones?²
In the present attempt to trace the chronological order of his
works, Ι may here take the liberty to translate this letter from
the original Latin, the language in which he composed all his
