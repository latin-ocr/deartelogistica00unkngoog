to the compositions now published. They are, in all proba-
bffity, the first-fruits of that immortal genius which eventually
drew from the mysterious depths of Numbers their pearl of
greatest price. Napier’s Arithmetic and Algebra will be re-
garded with reverential interest by all who can, in any degree,
appreciate the analytica] power, and the practical 'effects of the
Logarithms 3 especially if, in those treatises, we can trace the
preparatory labours of this secluded Scotish Baron, ere he

so unexpectedly displayed himself on a pinnacle of science to
which Kepler himself paid homage.

Napier published his great work, entitled ‘⁶ Mirifici Canonis
Logarithmorum Descriptio‚” in the year 1614. By that time
his mind was so deeply engrossed with the subject, and he was
so constantly employed,—-during the short interval between
the date of that publication and his death in 1617‚--with his

appears decisive upon the point is, that there cannot be dis-
covered throughout the whole of the work now printed an
