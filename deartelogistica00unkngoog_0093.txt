are the whole three—length, breadth‚ and thickness. In an)r
progression of numberS‚ increasing from unit by a common
ratio of multiplication‚ the second power contains two dimen-
sions of the root, and was called by the ancient geometricians
a square number, or square3 so the third power, being com-
posed of three dimensions of the root, obtained the name of a
cubic number, or cube. But here the imperfect analogy became
exhausted3 for, while the powers of a number are infinite,
extension in space admits of no other distinctions than the
three above mentioned. Hence, by an expedient incongruous
in idea as well as unwieldy in practice, the higher powers were
designated as if repetitions of the geometrica] dimensions.
This, will be seen from the following table, which‘ is given by
Napier in his earlier work on Algeer p. 92.

Here the signs are just an initial abbreviation of the words,

and scarcely less unmanageable in practice. Napier had sub-
