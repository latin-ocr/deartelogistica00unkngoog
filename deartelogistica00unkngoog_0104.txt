with which they are generated3 and calling these velocities of
the motions or increments Fluxions3 and the generated quanti-

ties Fluents, I fell by degrees upon the method of FluxionS,
which I have made use of here in the quadrature of curveS, in

the years 1665 and 1666? It is remarkable, that, instead of
merely referring to the ancients in this passage, Newton had
not rather said,—‘ And after this manner Napier, by drawing
a moveable point along a right line, taught the genesis of
Logarithms ; and when I speak of quantities becoming greater
or less according to the greater or less velocity with which the
increase and decrease are generated, and of determining quan-
tities from the velocities of the motions or incrementa with
which they are generated,—and when I call these velocities
of the motions or increments Fluxions,—I avail myself of
Napier’s demonstration, I adopt his language,—-and even his
very expressionS, ‘⁶ fluxn,'’ and ‘⁶ incrementi aut decrementi.”’
Newton may have closely studied Napier's published works, or
he may never have seen them. The first idea is suggested by
the above remarkable coincidences of thought and expression3
and also by the fact that Newton's Commentaries on Scriptural
prophecy is little else than a less elaborate repetition of Napier’s.
The other idea, however, is after all the more likely, from this
circumstance, that, throughout the voluminous published works
of Newton, mathematica] and theological, no notice of Napier
