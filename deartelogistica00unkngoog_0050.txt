In the mean while, reader, enj oy these labours such as they are,

himself and his son, the conclusion is inevitable, that the work
now given to the public was composed before his conception
of the Logarithms3 and that that invention, as well as his
subsequent minor inventions, arose out of the very attempt, to
abridge the toils of · calculation, which he indicates in the fifth
chapter of the second book of his Arithmetic, ‘⁶ De Multipli-
cationis et Pas-titionis Compendiis MiscellaneiS.” In order to
ascertain, then, the age of his Arithmetic and Algebra, we must
determine, as nearly as possible, the period of time when he
formed his conception of the Logarithms.

No one who has taken the trouble to examine Napier’s
original works, or who understands any thing of the nature
and construction of Logarithms, can doubt that many years of
labour must have elapsed, between the first idea of the system
in the inventor’s mind, and its publication, in 1614, accom-

lished aster his death had been composed for several years, as ·
