cated by the fact, that in the minor work (Lib. Ι. cap. 2) he
seleetS, as a numerica] example, ‘⁶ Annus Domini 1615.” Now,
supposing the Rhabdologia an invention of earlier date than
the Logarithms (which latter, as will presently appear, must
be referred to some time in the previous century), the year of
our Lord 1615, when thus selected for the example, was a year
yet to come3 and it is not likely that such an example would
have occurred to him, in place of a year either present or past.
Probably the year selected was that in which Napier was writing
at the time, a supposition perfectly consistent with his state-
ment, in the letter to the Chaucellor, that this minor invention
was for the benefit of those who might be disinclined to use the
Logarithms, and that it had become well known, and even been
carried abroad, before he was induced to publish it. For 1615
was the year after the publication of the Logarithms, and
the Rhabdologia was not printed until 1617.

There is only one circumstance which seems to interfere
with this chronology 3 but it is easily explained. In the fifthx
chapter of the second book of his Arithmetic, when expound- .
ing various compendious methods of multiplication and division,
Napier adds, ‘⁶ Sive omnium facillime per ossa Rhabdologiae
nostrae.” This might be supposed to afford decisive evidence
that the Rhabdologia was composed before the book of Arith-
