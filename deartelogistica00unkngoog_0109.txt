like manner, raise -2 to the index 4, and the radicate will be
÷163 so -2 and ÷2 are equally the quadripartient root of
16. Hence, says he, every abounding radicate, having an even
index, has two roots. These were what he called geminal.
But, he adds, if roots both abounding and defective belong
to the abounding radicate with an even index, then there is no
root of any kind left for the same radicates having the defective
sign prefixed. Hence, for example, 3-16 (in modern nota<-
tion, ζίῖἶὶ) is an impossible quantity. The ‘⁶ great emolu-
ment ” which Napier expected to bestow upon Mathematics by
this ghost of a quantity, can only be well understood by pro-
found mathematicians. Euler has devoted a chapter to impos-
sible ‘or imaginat-y quantities, which he concludes with these
observations ε “ It remains for us to remove any doubt which
may be entertained concerning the utility of the numbers of
which we have been speaking ; for those numbers being impos—

sible, it would not be surprising if they were thought entirely ⁰

useless, and the object only of an unfounded speculation. This,
however, would be a mistake 3 for the calculation of imaginary
quantities is of the greatest importance, as questions frequently
arise of which we cannot immediately say whether they include
any thing real and possible or not3 but when the solution of
such a question leads to imaginary numbers, we are certain
that what is required is impossible.'’
